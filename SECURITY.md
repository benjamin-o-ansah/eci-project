# Security Documentation

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. External Link Security
- All external links using `target="_blank"` include `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes
- Prevents potential window.opener security vulnerabilities
- Implemented in: Footer.tsx, Team.tsx, Contact.tsx, Donate.tsx

### 2. Form Input Security
- Email validation with proper regex patterns
- Input length limits (254 characters for emails)
- Rate limiting on form submissions (30-second cooldown)
- Client-side validation with user feedback
- Implemented in: Newsletter.tsx, Contact.tsx, Donate.tsx

### 3. Accessibility Security
- Proper ARIA attributes for form validation
- Screen reader announcements for errors and success messages
- Semantic HTML structure for better accessibility
- Error states clearly indicated with visual and textual feedback

### 4. Content Security Recommendations

#### For Production Deployment:
1. **Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers**
   ```
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://maps.googleapis.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self' https://api.stripe.com;
   ```

2. **Security Headers**
   ```
   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   X-Frame-Options: DENY
   X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
   ```

3. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   - Always serve the application over HTTPS in production
   - Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS
   - Use HSTS headers for enhanced security

### 5. API Integration Security

#### When integrating with backends:
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs server-side
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement request rate limiting
- Validate file uploads (if implemented)
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

### 6. Privacy and Data Protection
- Clear privacy policy and terms of service links
- Explicit consent for data collection
- Secure handling of personal information
- GDPR compliance considerations for EU users

### 7. Security Best Practices for Future Development
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
- Input validation on both client and server sides
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Secure session management (when authentication is added)
- Regular backup and disaster recovery procedures
